# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker
## Module 12 Challenge

## Description
The goal of this challenge was to create a Employee Tracker, where the user interacts with a command-line application that will take in information about employees and managers. The data collected from the users inputs will then be stored in a database which will hold data on employees (name, role, manager), as well as employee roles(role name, salary, department).
